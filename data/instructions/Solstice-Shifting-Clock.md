# Handmade Solstice Clock (Best Out of Waste)

Heyy, 

  


Solstice clock the name look really different, I found this in an article. I'm really mesmerized myself by watching this clock. Actually Solstice is a shape-shifting wooden clock designed by Matt Gilbert of the London-based studio Animaro. He says that in early days people are used to decide the time by observing the Sun movements, in noon time the sun reaches highest point and sun reaches the lowest point during sunset. The same thing happens in this clock, if this clock is exactly locked with the sun positions, we can say what exactly the time is. I know you love this thing, this will improve the guessing power in you. I want to make my own Solstice clock to place in my house. But I don't have enough money, or 3D printer to print. So I planned for making this clock using old PVC Pipe. Successfully I completed this clock using PVC with wood finishing look. I'm failed many times to built this, may be I missed the logic somewhere. At last I Made it and I want to share my experiences in this instructable. Then why late, Let's get started.

## Step 1: MAKING & CUTTING STRIPS

we have make 48 PVC Strips inclucing spares by using PVC pipe. Just follow the procedure, and do follow as it is.

  


Cut the PVC pipe on a length of 60cm.

Cut in between the pipe to make pvc sheet and iron it by placing a paper.

Apply the heat again and again so the pipe becomes a perfect sheet.

Then cut the PVC sheet into number of strips by the measurements below.

Length = 6cm

  


width = 1.5cm

  


total Strips required = 48 no's

  


Spare Strips = 5 no's

  


1 Crank Strip

## Step 2: Smoothing Edges

Wipe out the dust formed on the PVC strip using a sharp knife safely.  
Turn out the sharp edges of strips into smooth edges by using Sand Paper.  
Slowly apply uniform pressure on sand paper to rub on surface of the PVC strip. Do the same number of times until you satisfy the shape of edge.

![Smoothing Edges](https://www.instructables.com/assets/img/pixel.png)

## Step 3: Providing Holes

  
Make holes on both the ends of the strip, the size of the hole depends upon the revet pin thickness.  
Normal tool I used is scissor to make the holes bigger.  
Note that revet pin should easily rotate inside when placed in the hole.  
Every Strip should contain hole on both the ends.

## Step 4: Surface Finishing

To provide proper finishing or wood finishing on the strips at first we have to wipeout he dust formed on the strip surface. So follow these steps to make best finishing.

  


Step 1- Primer

  


Use the 80 grit sand paper and rub on the strip surface and move to 160 grit sand paper.

Do it the same process to the remaining strips.

After rubbing, apply some wood primer on the strips using a paint brush.

Note that, the more thicker of primer the best finish we get.

Dry it for 12hours in open Air, ther is no need to keep it under the sun light.

After drying, and again rub the surface using 220 grit sand paper for all the strips and finally dedust it.

  


Step 2- Gloss Paint

  


* I used the Gold Brown Gloss paint which looks really attractive and most available colour. Then apply the paint on the surface of the Strip using a paint brush. Let it dry for 12 hours.

  


Note: You should not touch the strips until it completely dries, otherwise the strip finish going to disturb.

## Step 5: Preparing Solticise Shape

* Interconnect the strips one by one like chain process, and finallly make round loop of mechanism.
* The strips are 20 degrees bends.
* Apply the same sequence to form a chain like structure
* finally join it in a loop.

## Step 6: Preparing Motor Guard

* Please watch the video, for getting better clarity, and detailed process, because it has more images.

## Step 7: Support Built

* These supports are for the chain linear movement.
* Please apply the oil for smooth movement of joints.

## Step 8: Providing Hand Mechanism

After making the Solstice chain, we need to provide the contracting and expanding mechanism to the chain by applying some linear force. The linear force can be induced by using a rotating crank mechanism from a motor. This mechanism forwards the force to the chain by placing a small length of rod in between chain and crank means it works as a mediator which transfers linear force through it. The chain will be place on the cycle spokes at four different directions.

## Step 9: Circuit

* Just follow the simple circuit.
* If your runs at higher speeds, please change the motor which runs at very low speeds.
![Circuit](https://www.instructables.com/assets/img/pixel.png)

## Step 10: Testing and Calibrating

* Control the Speed of motor using potentiometer.
* Set the speed of the clock depending upon sun positions.
* Calibrate Twice

Note: In noon time the sun reaches highest point and sun reaches the lowest point during sunset.


## Step 11: Showcase

* While placing the clcok, check the accurate position of the clock.
